## 🏗️ PROJECT ARCHITECTURE

### **Tech Stack:**
```
Frontend:  React + TypeScript + Vite
UI:        TailwindCSS + Glassmorphism
Database:  Firebase Firestore
Auth:      Firebase Authentication
Hosting:   Firebase Hosting
Routing:   React Router (v6)
State:     React Context
```

### **File Structure:**
```

```

### **Firestore Collections:**
```
Global:
├── users/              (All users with roles & status)
└── departments/        (All departments)

Per Department (isolated):
├── {departmentId}/workers/
├── {departmentId}/schedules/
├── {departmentId}/tasks/
└── {departmentId}/statistics/
```

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### **CRITICAL:**
- ✅ `.env` file with Firebase config (NOT in repo)
- ✅ `.gitignore` excludes all sensitive files
- ✅ Firestore rules enforce department isolation
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials anywhere
- ✅ Email verification required for approval
- ✅ Role-based route protection

### **Firestore Rules Philosophy:**
- Keep rules SIMPLE (no complex helpers)
- Use explicit checks, not circular dependencies
- Allow `list` for authenticated users, filter in app
- Developer role checked via Firestore `get()`
- Each department's data is completely isolated

---

## 🎨 UI/UX PATTERNS

### **Design System:**
```css
Background:     Glassmorphism with backdrop-blur
Cards:          bg-white/10 backdrop-blur-md rounded-2xl
Borders:        border-white/20
Hover:          hover:bg-white/15 transform hover:scale-105
Gradients:      from-[color]-600 to-[color]-600
```

### **Navigation Cards:**
Every dashboard uses this pattern:
- Title + Description + Icon + Optional Badge
- Hover effects with scale and glow
- Gradient border on hover
- Hebrew text with RTL

### **Loading States:**
Always show "טוען..." in Hebrew while fetching data.

### **Success/Error Messages:**
Use Hebrew text with color-coded backgrounds (green/red).

## 🧪 HOW TO TEST

### **Developer Flow:**
```bash
1. npm run dev
2. Go to http://localhost:5173
3. Login with developer credentials:
   - Email: daavedays@gmail.com
   - Password: [your password]
4. See Developer Dashboard
5. Click "בקשות ממתינות לאישור"
6. Approve/reject users
```

### **Owner Flow:**
```bash
1. Signup as new owner (different email)
2. Verify email (check inbox)
3. See "Waiting for approval" message
4. Login as developer → Approve owner
5. Logout → Login as owner
6. See Owner Dashboard with department info
```

### **Custom Department:**
```bash
1. Signup as owner
2. Select department: אחר
3. Enter custom name
4. Get approved by developer
5. Check Firestore → New department created!
```

## 🚨 COMMON ISSUES & FIXES

### **Issue: Permission Denied**
**Fix:** Check Firestore rules are published in Firebase Console.

### **Issue: User Not Appearing in Pending**
**Fix:** Ensure `emailVerified: true` in both Auth and Firestore.

### **Issue: undefined in Firestore**
**Fix:** Never pass `undefined`. Use conditional object building:
```typescript
const data: any = { required: 'value' };
if (optional) data.optional = optional;
await setDoc(docRef, data);
```

### **Issue: Circular Permission Error**
**Fix:** Simplify rules. Avoid complex helper functions.

## 💡 TIPS FOR NEXT AI

### **Before Starting:**
1. Read `MISSION_COMPLETE.md` to understand what exists
2. Read `.cursor/rules/best-practices.mdc` for patterns
3. Check `SECURITY_TEST_PLAN.md` to ensure you don't break anything

### **When Building:**
1. Break into phases (like we did!)
2. Test after each phase
3. Update TODOs as you go
4. Ask user for green light before big changes
5. Document everything

### **Communication:**
1. Use emojis for clarity (✅ ❌ 🎯 📋)
2. Explain what AND why
3. Show code snippets when relevant
4. Create summaries after completing work

### **Code Quality:**
1. TypeScript strict mode
2. JSDoc comments on all functions
3. Hebrew text everywhere (UI)
4. Try/catch on all Firestore operations
5. Loading states on all async actions
